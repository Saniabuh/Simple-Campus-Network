#Solution
In addressing the case study given, we first design the topology of the network.
Task 1
This section deals with planning, and designing the proposed network. The image depicted below shows the network topology for the University. The design has a total of three routers, a total of ten layer 2 switches and two layer 3 switches. There are also three servers including an external server hosted in a cloud environment. Each department and faculty has an end device attached for user usage. Each of the hosts is on a separate IP Network and different VLAN. The network is designed to allow scalability in case of expansion in the future.

The following are the IP networks for each department/Faculty
